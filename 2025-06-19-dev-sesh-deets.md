# Development Session Details - June 19, 2025

## Overview
This document captures all deviations from the original development plan for implementing OpenTelemetry trace evaluation in Lake Merritt. The original plan was to add OTel trace ingestion and a Criteria Selection Judge scorer.

## Deviations from Original Plan

### 1. **Fixed EvaluationItem Validation Error**
**Issue**: The `EvaluationItem` model rejected empty `expected_output` values, causing ingestion to fail.
**Original Plan**: Set `expected_output=""` 
**What We Did**: Changed to `expected_output="Selected criteria should appropriately match the user goal"`
**Why**: The Pydantic model had validation preventing empty strings. We needed a meaningful placeholder that describes what we're evaluating.

### 2. **Added Missing Logger Import**
**Issue**: `NameError: name 'logger' is not defined` in `app/pages/2_eval_setup.py`
**Original Plan**: Not addressed
**What We Did**: 
- Added `import logging`
- Added `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
**Why**: The error handling code referenced a logger that wasn't imported.

### 3. **Fixed API Key Configuration for New Scorer**
**Issue**: "Invalid or missing API key for openai" error when running Criteria Selection Judge
**Original Plan**: Not addressed
**What We Did**: Modified `core/evaluation.py` to include "criteria_selection_judge" in the API key injection logic:
```python
if scorer_name in ["llm_judge", "criteria_selection_judge"] and "api_key" not in config:
```
**Why**: The evaluation system only injected API keys for "llm_judge", not our new scorer.

### 4. **Fixed Streamlit Empty Label Warnings**
**Issue**: Multiple warnings about empty labels in text areas
**Original Plan**: Not addressed
**What We Did**: Added labels with `label_visibility="collapsed"` to all text areas in `app/pages/3_results.py`
**Why**: Streamlit requires labels for accessibility but we wanted to hide them visually.

### 5. **Created Test Data Files**
**Issue**: No test data was provided in the original plan
**Original Plan**: Only mentioned creating `fixtures/manual_traces.json`
**What We Did**: Created two test files:
- `fixtures/manual_traces.json` - Real OTel trace from user
- `test_traces_mixed_quality.json` - Simplified test with good/bad decisions
**Why**: Needed test data to verify the implementation worked correctly.

### 6. **Enhanced Criteria Format Handling**
**Issue**: Original traces had complex criteria objects with `criteria`, `reasoning`, and `rating` fields
**Original Plan**: Assumed simple string criteria
**What We Did**: 
- Modified ingester to extract only the `criteria` field from complex objects
- Updated scorer to handle both dict and string formats for criteria
**Why**: The real OTel traces had a richer structure than anticipated.

### 7. **Added Robust Error Handling to Scorer**
**Issue**: Generic "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" errors
**Original Plan**: Basic try/except
**What We Did**: Added specific handling for:
- Empty LLM responses
- JSON parsing errors with partial response logging
- Better error messages
**Why**: Needed better debugging information when LLM calls failed.

### 8. **Added Prompt Length Management**
**Issue**: Very long search summaries might exceed token limits
**Original Plan**: Not addressed
**What We Did**: 
- Added prompt length logging
- Automatic truncation of search summaries over 3000 characters
**Why**: The real traces contained detailed rental listings that made prompts very long.

### 9. **Fixed Security Issue - API Key Exposure**
**Issue**: API keys were exposed in exported reports
**Original Plan**: Not addressed
**What We Did**: Created `sanitize_config()` function in `core/reporting.py` to redact sensitive information
**Why**: Security vulnerability - API keys should never be in exported files.

### 10. **Documentation Location Change**
**Original Plan**: "Add to `README.md`"
**What We Did**: Added under a new "### Evaluating OpenTelemetry traces" subsection within the Architecture section
**Why**: Better organization of documentation.

## Additional Discoveries

### 1. **Trace Structure Complexity**
The actual OTel traces were much more complex than anticipated, with nested stages, timestamps, and rich metadata. This required more sophisticated parsing logic.

### 2. **Single vs Multiple Traces**
The original `manual_traces.json` only had 1 trace, not multiple as we initially assumed. The JSON structure had a `traces` array but with only one item.

### 3. **Pylance/VS Code Issues**
Encountered import resolution issues with VS Code/Pylance not recognizing the virtual environment. This was cosmetic and didn't affect functionality.

## Files Modified Beyond Original Plan

1. `core/evaluation.py` - API key injection
2. `app/pages/3_results.py` - Label visibility fixes
3. `core/reporting.py` - Security fix for API key exposure
4. `core/scoring/otel/criteria_selection_judge.py` - Enhanced error handling and format support

## Test Results

The implementation successfully:
- Loaded and processed the original OTel trace
- Scored it with 0.8/1.0 (PASSED)
- Provided meaningful reasoning about criteria selection quality
- Generated proper reports with the security fix applied

## Lessons Learned

1. Real-world data structures are often more complex than initial specifications
2. Security considerations (like API key exposure) need to be considered for all export functionality
3. Better error handling is crucial for LLM-based scorers
4. Test data creation is essential for validating implementations

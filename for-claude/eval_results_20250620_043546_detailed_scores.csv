The 'Number of Listings Identified' and 'Range of Prices Collected' directly address the need for understanding available options and pricing. 'Schedule Viewings' is also relevant, as it facilitates the next step in the apartment search process. However, the exclusion of 'Distance from Public Transit' and 'Prepare and Submit Applications' may limit the comprehensiveness of the search, but they are less critical for the initial planning phase."

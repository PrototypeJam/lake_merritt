        **Scoring Guidelines:**
        - 1.0: Identical citation (substance and format)
        - 0.9: Same case, minor punctuation/spacing differences
        - 0.8: Same case, different abbreviation style (e.g., "U.S." vs "US")
        - 0.7: Same case, missing/extra periods or commas
        - 0.5: Same case, different citation format
        - 0.3: Partially correct (wrong page/year but right case)
        - 0.0: Different case or fundamentally wrong
        
        **Common Variations to Accept:**
        - "U.S." vs "US" vs "U. S."
        - Single vs double spaces
        - "Int'l" vs "International"
        - "Comm'r" vs "Commissioner"
        - En dash (â€“) vs hyphen (-)

1. AI Agent Development: The first step in the development of our AI agents will be the selection of an appropriate AI model. We will utilize machine learning algorithms suitable for our transaction-conducting task, such as deep reinforcement learning that enables AI to make complex decisions through a continuous process of trial and error. Each AI agent will be developed with the capability to both comprehend the users’ needs and autonomously conduct transactions in response.

2. Ethical Compliance: To ensure our AI agents genuinely reflect and comply with fiduciary duties owed to the user-principals, they will be designed to abide by a strictly defined ethical framework. This will guide them to consistently act in the best interests of the user during transactions, adhering to the duty of loyalty, duty of care, and other fiduciary responsibilities. In line with data privacy norms and the established legal framework, the AI agents will not use or release user data without explicit consent.

3. Dataset Collection: Data plays a pivotal role in machine learning. Therefore, identifying and collecting relevant, high-quality data is crucial. The data will come from simulated transactions, past user behavior, and feedback. Using this data, we can train the AI agents to understand transaction types, user preferences, market dynamics, and pricing trends. All data usage will comply with data privacy laws and user consent provisions. 

4. AI Training: The collected data will be used to train our AI agents. Various training scenarios and transactions will be simulated to create a rich learning environment. The robustness of the learning will be evaluated against different transactional scenarios and user needs to ensure the AI agents demonstrate the practical understanding and competency necessary to conduct transactions accurately and ethically on behalf of the users.

5. Continuous Learning Capability: Our AI agents will not be static; their design will accommodate ongoing learning from post-deployment experiences. They will be programmed to learn from each completed transaction, dynamically adapting to evolving user needs and market conditions. This capability materially contributes to the improvement of their transactional efficiency and accuracy over time.

6. Iterative Development: To ensure functional proficiency, we will adopt an iterative approach to AI agent development, where feedback from each iteration informs and improves the next. This methodology allows for continuous refinement and improvement of the AI agent's capabilities.

This development and training plan for AI agents encapsulates our commitment to providing an AI platform that adheres unwaveringly to fiduciary duties and ethical guidelines, offering high-quality, evolving service to users. By employing this strategy, we aim to develop AI agents that not only conduct the transactional task efficiently but also succeed in earning the trust of our user-principals through their transparency and dedication to user interests.","Functional AI agents trained on relevant data, adhering to ethical guidelines and fiduciary duties, with continuous learning capabilities.",Step 3: AI Agent Development and Training,draft,"I need a plan to design, build, test, and deploy a platform that provdes AI agents that conduct transactions to purchase items for users.

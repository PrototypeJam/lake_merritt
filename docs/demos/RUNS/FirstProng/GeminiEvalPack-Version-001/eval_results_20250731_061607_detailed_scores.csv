This step is well-aligned with the user's overall goal of creating a flexible, secure, and user-friendly evaluation platform. It logically precedes other steps that would involve design, development, and deployment, ensuring that the platform's features are well-informed by user roles, data source compatibility, and security considerations.

The step is practical and detailed, covering essential aspects such as user roles, data formats, evaluation pack structures, reporting needs, and security audits. These elements are critical for the successful implementation of the platform, addressing both functional and non-functional requirements. However, the step could be enhanced by explicitly mentioning stakeholder engagement and iterative feedback loops to refine requirements continuously. Additionally, while the security audit is mentioned, a more detailed plan for how these audits will be conducted and integrated into the development lifecycle could strengthen this step.

Overall, this step is a good strategic choice, contributing positively to the project's success, though minor improvements could be made to ensure comprehensive stakeholder involvement and detailed security planning."

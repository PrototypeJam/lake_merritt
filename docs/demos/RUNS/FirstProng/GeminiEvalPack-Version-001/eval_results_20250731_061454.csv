The design for the Lake Merritt Open Evaluations Platform is based on a modular architecture that is highly scalable, maintainable, and secure. Its central theme is flexibility, designed to handle diverse data sources and accommodate different evaluation scenarios.

1. **Components and Structure**

    The architecture will consist of four main components: 
    - User Interface 
    - API Gateway
    - Evaluation Engine 
    - Data Management 

Each of these components will operate as distinct modules, which would promote scalability and maintainability.

2. **User Interface**

    The user interface will allow users to create, manage, and execute evaluation packs and configure/customize scorers. It will also present detailed results in an intuitive and interactive format. Advanced filtering capabilities will be included to help narrow down results based on different criteria.

3. **API Gateway**

    For external communication and user authentication, a secure and robust API gateway will be implemented. This central hub will handle all incoming and outgoing requests, provide secure endpoints, and manage API keys.

4. **Evaluation Engine**

    This will be the core logic section of the application. The evaluation engine will conduct the scoring and assessment process by leveraging both AI and automated methodologies. This component will integrate directly with the Data Management component to fetch necessary data and post-process results back to the data storage.

5. **Data Management**

    Responsible for all data handling tasks, this component will encompass the Data Ingestion, Processing, and Reporting sub-components. The data ingestion mechanism will support a variety of data sources and implement necessary transformation and validation operations. The data processing mechanism will leverage the evaluation pack templates and scorer configurations to perform evaluations. The reporting sub-component will generate comprehensive reports for further analysis or compliance needs.

6. **External Integrations**

    The system will rely on API-based collaborations with external systems, allowing users to offer their specific API keys for model access.

7. **Security Framework**

    in order to maintain a secure environment, security measures will be incorporated in all steps of data handling, user access control, and communication. Advanced encryption solutions will be implemented for API key management, and all data transactions will be secured using SSL. Additionally, a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism will be in place to ensure proper authorization.

8. **Database Schema**

    A hybrid schema comprising relational and non-relational databases will be built. The schema will incorporate key details regarding evaluation packs, scorers, and users. Non-relational database collections will be used for storing datasets and rich execution traces.

9. **Scalability and Maintainability**

    Given the modular architecture, the system will support expansion in terms of more users, evaluations, and data sources. With a layered approach, individual components can be updated or replaced without affecting other functionalities.
  
This system architecture design aims to offer a flexible, scalable, and user-friendly platform while ensuring high security and seamless integration features.

4.1 Data Ingestion

Structured datasets, unstructured datasets, and rich execution traces are primary data sources for the Lake Merritt Open Evals Platform. Our solution proposes a comprehensive data ingestion strategy that will ensure a successful data flow from our diverse sources into the platform:
 
- The design should handle structured and unstructured data using different connectors such as JDBC, APIs, ERP systems, web servers or even real-time sources such as IoT devices. 
- A robust scheduling feature will allow users to time data extraction according to their specific needs.
- Data splits, sharding, and parallel processing techniques will be employed to ensure the optimal speed and efficiency of data ingestion. 

4.2 Data Processing

We propose a robust data processing design to ensure that the incoming data is ready for evaluation:

- The structure of the data processing pipeline will be divided into multiple stages, such as data cleansing, transformation/normalization, and aggregation.
- A flexible transformation framework will be included to accommodate different levels of data complexity. This will include functions for handling missing values, outlier detection, and handling categorical data among others.
- Data optimization techniques like indexing, compression, and efficient data types for storage will be used for faster data retrieval and processing.
- An automated process will be in place to handle data quality checks, ensuring that the data ingested is reliable and relevant for assessment.

4.3 Data Storage and Retrieval 

In addressing data storage, this design will strike a balance between cost, speed, security, and data availability:

- A modular design of data storage is proposed where each type of ingestion or processing job can define its own storage layout. This could vary from a simple local file system storage to more sophisticated options like columnar storage or distributed storage, depending on the user requirements.
- Indexing will be enforced on all searchable fields, making data retrieval faster.
- To ensure reliability and secure access, storage will enforce robust disaster recovery mechanisms, data versioning, and backup facilities.
- A robust User-API-data-store interaction will be implemented to guarantee that users can securely provide their API keys, view detailed results, and download their comprehensive reports.

This design will maximize efficiency and reliability in the ingestion, processing, and storage of data on the Lake Merritt Open Evals Platform. It adheres to all necessary security protocols, making it a reliable and highly functional solution.","CONTEXT: You are a top consultant called in to deliver a final version of the deliverable for this step of the project.

User Interface Design:

1. Dashboard: The main landing page after login should be a user dashboard. The dashboard will provide a snapshot of the most recent evaluations, a list of created evaluation packs and the status of each. This visual representation should be dynamic, allowing users to quickly understand the current state of their assessments, and access deep-dives on them with a single click. 

2. Evaluation Pack Creation and Management: Users should be able to create and manage evaluation packs easily. We'll design a user-friendly, guided process for defining, saving and revising these packs, which will include defining the evaluation steps, integrating the scorers, and running simulations. This interface should allow users to understand the logic of the evaluations and easily make alterations where necessary. 

3. Interactive Result Exploration: After the evaluation pack has been executed, users need tools to interactively filter and explore the outcomes. For this, we propose a results page designed intuitively and featuring filtration options, drill-down capability for detailed viewing, and side-by-side comparison functionality. 

Reporting Design:

4. Reporting Framework: An inherent reporting module will be integrated into the platform. Following the execution of evaluation packs, the module will generate reports automatically. The reports will provide comprehensive results and details of each evaluation, rendered in an easy-to-understand format that includes detailed descriptions, visual representations, and statistical breakdowns.

5. Customization: Allowing users to customize their reports will also be integrated. Users will be able to select which details to include, how data is represented and the order in which information appears. 

6. Download and Share: Users should have the option to download their reports in various formats (PDF, Excel, CSV, etc.) for further analysis or compliance needs. Sharing options should also be included to enable users to distribute results via email or other collaboration tools directly from the platform. 

Authentication and Authorization:

7. User session management will be developed to provide secure login and logout processes. Role-based access control will be integrated to manage what each user role can see and interact with. This will ensure only authorized users have access to specific resources. 

By focusing on the usability and effectiveness of the interface and reporting tools, we can ensure that they meet the needs of the end-users in a way that is not only attractive and intuitive but also facilitates efficiency and precision in the evaluation process.","CONTEXT: You are a top consultant called in to deliver a final version of the deliverable for this step of the project.

Security Measures:

Data Protection:
The security of the platform will be based on the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), with granular control over data accessibility depending on user roles and permissions. We will implement strong data encryption standards (AES-256) for data storage and during transmission, in addition to hashing for sensitive data such as API keys.

Access Control:
Access to the Open Evals Platform will be regulated by a secure protocol such as OAuth 2.0. User sessions will implement automatic timeouts, and a tiered authentication mechanism will be in place with Multifactor Authentication (MFA) enforced for higher privilege roles or crucial actions.

API Security:
Secure mechanisms for user API key management are implemented, such as an encrypted secure vault to store the keys. Throttling and rate limiting policies should also be enforced on APIs to prevent abuse or DoS attacks.

Data Leak Prevention:
Policies will be put in place to prevent unintentional data leaks. This includes log sanitization practices to ensure no sensitive information is logged accidentally, and Content Disarm & Reconstruction (CDR) for file uploads to prevent malware attacks.

Intrusion Detection & Prevention:
Anomaly detection strategies should be implemented to identify possible malicious activities. This could include algorithms to track and alert unusual activities as well as a firewall to protect against unauthorised access.

Compliance Requirements:

Ensuring that the platform is compliant with relevant data privacy laws such as GDPR, CCPA or HIPAA depending on the nature of the data handled and the geographical location of the users. This may require features like anonymization, user consent management, and the ability for users to delete their data.

Conducting Security Audit & Vulnerability Assessments:

We will conduct regular third-party security audits to validate our security measures and identify potential vulnerabilities. Automated tools will also be used to continuously monitor and scan for security vulnerabilities. Results from these assessments should drive continual improvements to the system's security.

Disaster Recovery Plan:

Establish a thorough disaster recovery plan to ensure the continuity of the platform and the protection of data during an unexpected event like a natural disaster or a cyber-attack. The plan should detail data backup mechanisms, escalation process, and recovery steps to minimize downtime and data loss.

Together, these measures will ensure a robust security environment for the Lake Merritt Open Evals Platform, protecting user data, maintaining integrity of the evaluation processes, and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations. 

The design of the security and compliance elements will be iteratively refined and tested for robustness, ensuring the platform remains safe, trustworthy, and user-centric.","CONTEXT: You are a top consultant called in to deliver a final version of the deliverable for this step of the project.

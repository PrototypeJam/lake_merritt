plan_delta,LLM Judge,1.0,True,"The final revised plan for the Lake Merritt Open Evals Platform shows significant improvements and expansions over the initial plan, making it somewhat more likely to achieve the original goal. The revisions address many of the detailed aspects of the platform's design and build requirements, such as user roles, system architecture, data ingestion, and security measures. The plan now includes more comprehensive descriptions of user roles, data formats, and security protocols, which align well with the original goal of creating a flexible and secure evaluation platform.

However, there are still areas where the plan could be further improved. For instance, while the revised plan provides more detail on the system architecture and user interface, it could benefit from additional specifics on how these components will work together to enable the creation of flexible evaluation packs and AI-powered scorers. Additionally, the plan could offer more concrete examples and scenarios to illustrate how the platform will handle diverse data sources and evaluation scenarios.

Overall, the revisions have made the plan more robust and detailed, addressing many of the initial gaps and providing a clearer path towards achieving the original goal. Therefore, the plan is somewhat more likely to achieve the goal, warranting a score of 4."
